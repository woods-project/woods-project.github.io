Choosing a song as an anchor for a chapter can be subjective, as it depends on the tone and atmosphere you want to create. However, considering the theme of finding a scientist in a lab coat embedded halfway through the hood of a pick Cadillac, a song that conveys a sense of mystery, intrigue, or even a touch of eccentricity could be fitting. Here are a few suggestions:

1. "Kashmir" by Led Zeppelin: This epic and atmospheric song has a mystical quality that could enhance the intrigue of the scene.
2. "Mr. Brightside" by The Killers: While not directly related to the theme, the energetic and enigmatic nature of this song might add a sense of curiosity and unexpectedness to the chapter.
3. "Mad World" by Gary Jules: This haunting and melancholic song could help create a somber and mysterious atmosphere, emphasizing the unusual discovery in the chapter.
4. "Welcome to the Black Parade" by My Chemical Romance: This dramatic and theatrical song could add a touch of grandeur and intensity to the chapter, matching the unusual situation.

Ultimately, the choice of song will depend on your personal preferences and the desired tone of the chapter.
