## Characters

So far, the details for these are entirely human generated, though the images did come from [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/app/users/1053441274302173235/).  Eventually I'll try to capture the process I used to create the images.

### Neil 
![[character-neil-collins.png|200]]

**Neil Collins** on lead guitar.  

In his senior year of high school.  Average height but a little lean, with wild naturally red hair that he wears a little long so that it looks like Dave Mustaine.  

Neil is a massive manga fan and a talented artist, and is currently writing a graphic novel series with characters based loosely on his friends, band-mates, and folks around the county.  He's following the time-honored tradition of Stan Lee and makes most of his characters names alliterative.
- Fran Freckles
- Bear Braveheart
- Ivy Ice 
- Ruby Round

So far he has shared his art with no one.

### Rica
![[character-erica-blevins.png|200]]

**Erica Blevins** on rhythm guitar and vocals.

Also a senior.  5'6" and stunning.  Most of the guys in the band have a bit of a crush on her, but she's honestly more interested in Julie, a 23 year old waitress at "The Roost", the local dive bar that's incredibly lax on carding.  Spirited and both proud and embarrassed by her freckles.  Long hair that she usually has dyed purple, and cuts the sides short on one side like a Belta from that old show 'The Expanse' made before Amazon was dismantled.  Leather and piercings.

Erica comes from a hard home life and has an older brother named Eli who is developmentally challenged, so she fills the role of the protective older sister.  This spills over to her friends, and she is quick to get 'back in their face' when anybody gives them a hard time.

Erica's mom was Paige Winters, who was the step-daughter of one of the crusty old guys who aid and abet the kids later in the story.

Note: Eli will figure prominently later in the story.

### Byr
![[character-byron-reynolds.png|200]]

**Byron Reynolds** on bass quitar.

Byron insists on going by the name Byr, but only Erica calls him that consistently; the rest of the crew  have known him for years still call him Byron.  Younger than he looks and standing at a respectable 5'11", a little heavy at over 200 pounds , but to be fair a lot of it is muscle and he is "strong as a hoss".  He has shoulder length light brown hair and the beginnings of a mighty beard.  He is fascinated by Norse mythology, wears Thor's Hammer on a braided leather band around his neck, and plays bass guitar.

### Ivy

**Zhang Lei Min** on synth and backing vocals.

Ivy Zhang is the daughter of Dr. Zhang, who moved to "the county" ten years ago to work at the hospital.  She goes by **Ivy** to her friends, and gets embarrassed when her parents call her Xiao Lei (roughly 'little mountain' or 'little thunder') in public.  The mean girls at school call her 'little lay'.  

She's 4'11" with a jet-black bob haircut, which she colors blue during concerts.  Originally only a fan of the band who dated Sam "for like, all of a week" when they were in ninth grade, and who would listen from the ratty couch as they practiced, she's beginning to come out of her shell and use her years of piano practice on the synths, and fills in occasionally on other people's guitars.  

She's beginning to be comfortable enough to sing backup and harmony, and before the end of the story she's going to fully find her voice and SHRED IT in a spirited rendition of {FIND A SONG}.

### Sam

**Sam Green** on percussion.

"Spell it like the color, no e!" he has to say 10 times a day.  He has a bit of a chip on his shoulder at being the 'smallest guy in the room' at 5'6" and 133 pounds, but his incredible dexterity and ability to OWN the drums is beginning to show him that he's "like a dime in a pocket full of pennies".

### Secondary Characters
- Ruby - unofficial band manager
- Julie - waitress at the Roost
