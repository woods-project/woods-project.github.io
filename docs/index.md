### Summary

In a small town in Eastern Tennessee, five role-playing misfit teens nostalgic for the age of punk discover a a mysterious obelisk in the nearby woods.  As they delve deeper into strange occurrences in their rural community, they soon discover that their reality is not what it seems. 

When the group comes across a scientist trapped in a burning car miles from the nearest road, they begin to suspect that the strange events may somehow be related to experiments at the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Discovering that zetta-scale quantum computing is thinning the walls of reality, the friends find themselves on the run from a powerful organization and at the center of a web of deceit, greed, and corruption that threatens to unravel the fabric of reality itself.

With the help of a group of 60-something year old rebels, the teens must navigate a dangerous world of government cover-ups, corporate greed, and existential horror, all while testing the limits of their friendship and musical skills.

Set in an Appalachia of the not too distant future, "woods" is a heart-pounding young adult science fiction adventure that blends the best of "The Peripheral", "Stranger Things", and the Lovecraftian universe into a thrilling yet humorous tale of discovery, rebellion, and the power of friendship. With its thought-provoking themes and edge-of-your-seat suspense, this novel is a must-read for fans of the genre and anyone who loves a good story about beating the odds and sticking it to the man.


## Chapters

The `ChatGPT Monomyth Titles` are what I got when I prompted:

> Outline the plot of a story that takes place in eastern Tennessee in 2032, about a group of teenagers discovering apparently occult Lovecraft inspired oddities in the woods which turn out of be due to the massive concentration of quantum computation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where computation thins the layer between realities like in The Laundry series. Also be inspired by The Peripheral and Stranger Things. The main characters are slightly geeky and don't fit in well with southern culture, are progressive, like punk music. There are 3 boys and 2 girls in the core group of friends, all high-school age. There is a subplot of a love triangle, but the major plot points are about the occult, quantum computing, government coverups, and teenage rebellion.

> Now for this story, give me the titles of 17 chapters, which follow Campbell's monomyth and the Harmon story circle, which posits that the protagonists move through 8 points, those being: 1) the are in a zone of comfort, 2) but they want something they don't have, 3) so they enter an unfamiliar situation, and 4) adapt to it, 5) thus getting what they wanted, but 6) pay a heavy price for it, after which they 7) return to their familiar situation, 8) having changed both themselves and the world around them.

Amusingly enough, there actually are 17 phases in Campbells' monomyth!  I just picked 17 because I like prime numbers and 13 seemed too few.   I can get behind the thematic mapping for the first 9 or 10 chapters, but then it gets squirrelly until the last chapter or two. 

Another creative forcing function I'm going to embrace is mapping each of the chapters to a song.  Given the gang's proclivity, Sex Pistols, Ramones, etc. should figure prominently, but for some rason Mr Blue Sky popped to mind when I thought about the county normies being oblivious to the changes just wrought on the world.  This may have something to do with the bittersweet optimism of being just on the edge of the important things happening felt by [Elton Pope](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Elton_Pope) as he listened to the song.

## Characters

So far, the details for these are entirely human generated, though the images did come from [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/app/users/1053441274302173235/).  Eventually I'll try to capture the process I used to create the images.

### Neil 
![[character-neil-collins.png|200]]

**Neil Collins** on lead guitar.  

In his senior year of high school.  Average height but a little lean, with wild naturally red hair that he wears a little long so that it looks like Dave Mustaine.  

Neil is a massive manga fan and a talented artist, and is currently writing a graphic novel series with characters based loosely on his friends, band-mates, and folks around the county.  He's following the time-honored tradition of Stan Lee and makes most of his characters names alliterative.
- Fran Freckles
- Bear Braveheart
- Ivy Ice 
- Ruby Round

So far he has shared his art with no one.

### Rica
![[character-erica-blevins.png|200]]

**Erica Blevins** on rhythm guitar and vocals.

Also a senior.  5'6" and stunning.  Most of the guys in the band have a bit of a crush on her, but she's honestly more interested in Julie, a 23 year old waitress at "The Roost", the local dive bar that's incredibly lax on carding.  Spirited and both proud and embarrassed by her freckles.  Long hair that she usually has dyed purple, and cuts the sides short on one side like a Belta from that old show 'The Expanse' made before Amazon was dismantled.  Leather and piercings.

Erica comes from a hard home life and has an older brother named Eli who is developmentally challenged, so she fills the role of the protective older sister.  This spills over to her friends, and she is quick to get 'back in their face' when anybody gives them a hard time.

Erica's mom was Paige Winters, who was the step-daughter of one of the crusty old guys who aid and abet the kids later in the story.

Note: Eli will figure prominently later in the story.

### Byr
![[character-byron-reynolds.png|200]]

**Byron Reynolds** on bass quitar.

Byron insists on going by the name Byr, but only Erica calls him that consistently; the rest of the crew  have known him for years still call him Byron.  Younger than he looks and standing at a respectable 5'11", a little heavy at over 200 pounds , but to be fair a lot of it is muscle and he is "strong as a hoss".  He has shoulder length light brown hair and the beginnings of a mighty beard.  He is fascinated by Norse mythology, wears Thor's Hammer on a braided leather band around his neck, and plays bass guitar.

### Ivy

**Zhang Lei Min** on synth and backing vocals.

Ivy Zhang is the daughter of Dr. Zhang, who moved to "the county" ten years ago to work at the hospital.  She goes by **Ivy** to her friends, and gets embarrassed when her parents call her Xiao Lei (roughly 'little mountain' or 'little thunder') in public.  The mean girls at school call her 'little lay'.  

She's 4'11" with a jet-black bob haircut, which she colors blue during concerts.  Originally only a fan of the band who dated Sam "for like, all of a week" when they were in ninth grade, and who would listen from the ratty couch as they practiced, she's beginning to come out of her shell and use her years of piano practice on the synths, and fills in occasionally on other people's guitars.  

She's beginning to be comfortable enough to sing backup and harmony, and before the end of the story she's going to fully find her voice and SHRED IT in a spirited rendition of {FIND A SONG}.

### Sam

**Sam Green** on percussion.

"Spell it like the color, no e!" he has to say 10 times a day.  He has a bit of a chip on his shoulder at being the 'smallest guy in the room' at 5'6" and 133 pounds, but his incredible dexterity and ability to OWN the drums is beginning to show him that he's "like a dime in a pocket full of pennies".

### Secondary Characters
- Ruby - unofficial band manager
- Julie - waitress at the Roost
- Eli - Erica's older brother
- The crew - crusty old guys from the mountains

#### Myles, one of The Crew

## Plot Points

As of Friday, Feb 10, the below are almost entirely machine generated except where bolded in Chapter 1.  For the first 10 chapters I would just ask "write up the story points for Chapter X" and remind it of the title.  Things started going off the rails a little at Chapter 10, so I stepped up and became a little more of a heavy handed creative director.

### Chapter 1: Small Town Life

> In **the small town of Sunbright in** Eastern Tennessee in 2032, life is predictable and routine. **Obesity is common, bad country music plays on every radio, and the only news is Fox news**.  Five teenagers at the center of the story are all high-school age and live in a community where everyone knows everyone else, **but these 5 are united by feeling like they don't fit in**.

### Chapter 10: The Dangers of the Unknown

Chapter 10 took a rewrite or two - ChatGPT was trying to end things here and generally started to lose coherence.  I reminded it about what it had suggested for chapter 9 and told it to keep going.

> Chapter 10 follows the events of Chapter 9, in which the main characters uncovered the truth behind the government cover-up and the unchecked scientific experimentation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. In Chapter 10, the full extent of the dangers of the unknown are revealed as the teens face their greatest challenge yet.

The stage is set for the final showdown, as the teens take on the government and those in power in a battle to expose the truth and bring an end to the experiments.


### Chapter 11: The Love Triangle

After the missteps w/ chapter 10, I started getting a little more prescriptive:  

*Now, how about the story points / talking points for "Chapter 11: The Love Triangle", in which the stress of the events of "Chapter 10: The Dangers of the Unknown" threaten to rupture the friendship of two of the male characters due to their mutual feelings for one of the female characters*.

> Chapter 11 introduces a subplot of a love triangle, as the stress of the events in Chapter 10 begins to take a toll on the main characters. Two of the male characters are revealed to have mutual feelings for one of the female characters, threatening to rupture their friendship.

> As the teens face the full extent of the dangers of the unknown and the final showdown with those in power, the love triangle adds to the already high stakes of the story. The male characters must navigate their feelings for the female character, as well as their loyalty to each other, in order to keep their friendship intact.

> The chapter highlights the theme of love and relationships, as well as the importance of friendship and loyalty in the face of adversity. It showcases the challenges that the main characters face in their personal lives, as they balance their feelings with the demands of their mission.

> As the chapter concludes, the male characters are faced with a difficult decision about what to do next, as the stress of the love triangle threatens to disrupt their friendship and mission. The stage is set for the final showdown, as the teens must navigate their personal feelings and relationships in order to succeed in their mission to stop the experiments and save their town and the world.

### Chapter 12: The Battle for the Truth

Here I started taking an even heavier hand and guided it to include the old guys: 

*Excellent, now write the story points / talking points for "Chapter 12: The Battle for the Truth" in which the interpersonal stress that came to a head in "Chapter 11: The Love Triangle" is resolved and the novel comes to it's penultimate climax, pitting a newly reinvigorated group against the unethical criminal conspiracy. The group has expanded to include numerous memorable characters from the surrounding towns, including a group of 60-something year olds who were martial artists, emergency medical technicians, and hackers in their younger days. The expanded group of characters are fascinating and will each have their own spin-off novel someday*.

> Chapter 12 marks the penultimate climax of the story, as the main characters and their allies come together to face the unethical criminal conspiracy. The interpersonal stress that came to a head in Chapter 11 is resolved, as the characters come together to take on the final challenge.

> The group of characters has expanded to include numerous memorable allies from the surrounding towns, including a group of 60-something year olds who were martial artists, emergency medical technicians, and hackers in their younger days. These characters add to the already rich cast of characters and provide a unique perspective on the events of the story.

> As the group faces off against the unethical criminal conspiracy, they use all of their skills and knowledge to expose the truth and bring an end to the dangerous experiments at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The chapter highlights the bravery and determination of the main characters, as well as the importance of teamwork and unity in the face of adversity.

> As the chapter concludes, the stage is set for the final showdown, as the expanded group of characters use all of their skills and knowledge to stop the experiments and save their town and the world. The chapter showcases the exciting and dynamic interactions of the characters and sets the stage for the thrilling conclusion of the story.


### Chapter 13: The Power of Friendship

I think maybe ChatGPT was getting tired by now.  It originally started with "Chapter 13 marks the conclusion of the story...".  I started to feel like I was scolding a child: 

*No, the story doesn't conclude in Chapter 13. Rewrite the story points / talking points of "Chapter 13: The Power of Friendship", ending with the final showdown, but which will have following chapters outlining the aftermath of the of the battle and the attempts to return to normal*.

> Chapter 13 marks the climax of the story, as the power of interpersonal loyalty and brotherly love comes to the fore in the final showdown against the unethical criminal conspiracy. The main characters and their allies use their skills and knowledge to stop the experiments and bring an end to the dangerous situation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

> Throughout the story, the main characters have faced challenges and obstacles, but they have always had each other to rely on. The chapter highlights the importance of friendship and the power of unity in the face of adversity.

> As the final showdown takes place, the main characters and their allies use their skills and knowledge to stop the experiments and bring an end to the unethical criminal conspiracy. The chapter showcases the bravery and determination of the main characters, as well as the power of friendship and brotherly love to triumph over evil.

> As the chapter concludes, the main characters are triumphant, having put an end to the dangerous experiments and exposed the government cover-up. However, the story is far from over, as the aftermath of the battle must be dealt with and the town and the world must attempt to return to normal. The chapter ends on a note of both triumph and uncertainty, as the main characters look forward to what comes next.

Much better. 

### Chapter 14: The Return to Normalcy

> Chapter 14 marks the aftermath of the final showdown, as the main characters and their allies attempt to return to normalcy. The chapter explores the characters' realization and acknowledgement of how much the world around them has changed, and the challenges they face as they attempt to adjust to their new reality.

> As the characters come to terms with the events of the story, they feel a newfound sense of belonging thanks to their strengthened relationships and their realization that there is a larger culture of freaks like them fighting for a better future. This includes the 60-something year olds introduced in Chapter 13, who provide a unique perspective on the events of the story.

> However, the characters also feel even more disconnected from much of the southern "normie" culture around them, who are completely unaware of the tremendous changes to the world that have occurred through the course of the story.
