### Summary

In a small town in Eastern Tennessee, five role-playing misfit teens nostalgic for the age of punk discover a a mysterious obelisk in the nearby woods.  As they delve deeper into strange occurrences in their rural community, they soon discover that their reality is not what it seems. 

When the group comes across a scientist trapped in a burning car miles from the nearest road, they begin to suspect that the strange events may somehow be related to experiments at the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  Discovering that zetta-scale quantum computing is thinning the walls of reality, the friends find themselves on the run from a powerful organization and at the center of a web of deceit, greed, and corruption that threatens to unravel the fabric of reality itself.

With the help of a group of 60-something year old rebels, the teens must navigate a dangerous world of government cover-ups, corporate greed, and existential horror, all while testing the limits of their friendship and musical skills.

Set in an Appalachia of the not too distant future, "woods" is a heart-pounding young adult science fiction adventure that blends the best of "The Peripheral", "Stranger Things", and the Lovecraftian universe into a thrilling yet humorous tale of discovery, rebellion, and the power of friendship. With its thought-provoking themes and edge-of-your-seat suspense, this novel is a must-read for fans of the genre and anyone who loves a good story about beating the odds and sticking it to the man.

The summary above, the chapter list, and the [[Plot Points|plot points]] were all generated during a single ~45 minute session w/ ChatGPT, starting with the following promp:

> Outline the plot of a story that takes place in eastern Tennessee in 2032, about a group of teenagers discovering apparently occult Lovecraft inspired oddities in the woods which turn out of be due to the massive concentration of quantum computation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where computation thins the layer between realities like in The Laundry series. Also be inspired by The Peripheral and Stranger Things. The main characters are slightly geeky and don't fit in well with southern culture, are progressive, like punk music. There are 3 boys and 2 girls in the core group of friends, all high-school age. There is a subplot of a love triangle, but the major plot points are about the occult, quantum computing, government coverups, and teenage rebellion.

The initial plot summary was pretty crufty - the one at the top of this page was actually the output of about 5-10 rounds of back and forth dialogue, during which  details like the obelisk, the scientist in the burning car, and the 60-year olds were introduced by the human.

Then ChatGPT was prompted for chapter titles with the following prompt that [[Xanadu/woods/Story Mechanics|referenced Campbell's Monomyth and described Harmon's Story Circle]]:

> Now for this story, give me the titles of 17 chapters, which follow Campbell's monomyth and the Harmon story circle, which posits that the protagonists move through 8 points, those being: 1) the are in a zone of comfort, 2) but they want something they don't have, 3) so they enter an unfamiliar situation, and 4) adapt to it, 5) thus getting what they wanted, but 6) pay a heavy price for it, after which they 7) return to their familiar situation, 8) having changed both themselves and the world around them.

Though I didn't explicitly remember it, there actually **are** 17 phases in Campbells' monomyth!  I just picked 17 because I like prime numbers and 13 seemed too few.   

Possibly because of that synchronicity ChatGPT initially echoed the stages of the Monomyth **verbatim** as the chapter titles.  I chastised it a little and asked for a redo, supplying it the story summary again.  This finally resulted in the `ChatGPT Chapter Title Version 2` titles above.

I can get behind the thematic mapping for the first 9 or 10 chapters, but then it gets squirrelly until the last chapter or two. 

From there, I prompted chapter by chapter for the [[Plot Points|plot points]], and then brainstormed the [[Characters|characters]], using Midjourney and some creative prompting for the character sketches.  I also used Midjourney to `/imagine` what the cover of the book should look like, which I cleaned up a little to add human-readable words (most SOTA image generation at present doesn't have the ability to generate readable words quite yet).



As of February 21, I've disected a recent read that was fun and accessible, Walkaways by Cory Doctorow, 

Another creative forcing function I'm going to embrace is mapping each of the chapters to a song.  Given the gang's proclivity, Sex Pistols, Ramones, etc. should figure prominently, but for some reason Mr Blue Sky popped to mind when I thought about the county normies being oblivious to the changes just wrought on the world.  This may have something to do with the bittersweet optimism of being just on the edge of the important things happening felt by [Elton Pope](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Elton_Pope) as he listened to the song.

### Notes on this site

This novel and this site are being composed in Obsidian.md, a recent 'plain text connected thinking' app I started seriously using on New Year's Eve.

In addition to my 'private memex' of reading notes, daily logs, drafts for blog posts, to-do lists, concept maps, and project boards, I have a folder for this project which is symlinked to a stand-alone git repo which uses mkdocs to compile the website you're reading.  

The use of Cory Doctorow as a reviewer on the fake cover is aspirational - he's never heard of Michael, though I'd bet anything he's heard of ChatGPT and has opinions.

As promised above, a note on [[Scene Notes]] - the view you get is a little underwhelming.  In Obsidian, I'm using the Kanban plugin, so my scene notes look like this for nice visual thinking, easy reordering, and color-coding of which character is in which scene:
