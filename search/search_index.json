Also be inspired by The Peripheral and Stranger Things. The main characters are slightly geeky and don't fit in well with southern culture, are progressive, like punk music. There are 3 boys and 2 girls in the core group of friends, all high-school age. There is a subplot of a love triangle, but the major plot points are about the occult, quantum computing, government coverups, and teenage rebellion. ... Now for this story, give me the titles of 17 chapters, which follow Campbell's monomyth and the Harmon story circle, which posits that the protagonists move through 8 points, those being: 1) the are in a zone of comfort, 2) but they want something they don't have, 3) so they enter an unfamiliar situation, and 4) adapt to it, 5) thus getting what they wanted, but 6) pay a heavy price for it, after which they 7) return to their familiar situation, 8) having changed both themselves and the world around them.</p> <p>Amusingly enough, there actually are 17 phases in Campbells' monomyth!  I just picked 17 because I like prime numbers and 13 seemed too few.   I can get behind the thematic mapping for the first 9 or 10 chapters, but then it gets squirrelly until the last chapter or two. </p> <p>Another creative forcing function I'm going to embrace is mapping each of the chapters to a song.  Given the gang's proclivity, Sex Pistols, Ramones, etc. should figure prominently, but for some rason Mr Blue Sky popped to mind when I thought about the county normies being oblivious to the changes just wrought on the world.  This may have something to do with the bittersweet optimism of being just on the edge of the important things happening felt by Elton Pope as he listened to the song.</p> ChatGPT Monomyth Title Song Short Description Harmon Campbell Chapter 1: Small Town Life Intro the characters, and hints at strange things in town 1.
