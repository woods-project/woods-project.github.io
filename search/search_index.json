Freedom to Live <p>The summarysummary above, the chapter list, and the plot points were all generated during a single ~45 minute session w/ ChatGPT, starting with the following prompt:</p> <p>Outline the plot of a story that takes place in eastern Tennessee in 2032, about a group of teenagers discovering apparently occult Lovecraft inspired oddities in the woods which turn out of be due to the massive concentration of quantum computation at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where computation thins the layer between realities like in The Laundry series. Also be inspired by The Peripheral and Stranger Things. The main characters are slightly geeky and don't fit in well with southern culture, are progressive, like punk music. There are 3 boys and 2 girls in the core group of friends, all high-school age. There is a subplot of a love triangle, but the major plot points are about the occult, quantum computing, government coverups, and teenage rebellion.</p> <p>The initial plot summary was pretty crufty - the one at the top of this page was actually the output of about 5-10 rounds of back and forth dialogue, during which  details like the obelisk, the scientist in the burning car, and the 60-year olds were introduced by the human.</p> <p>Then ChatGPT was prompted for chapter titles with the following prompt that referenced Campbell's Monomyth and described Harmon's Story Circle</p> <p>Now for this story, give me the titles of 17 chapters, which follow Campbell's monomyth and the Harmon story circle, which posits that the protagonists move through 8 points, those being: 1) the are in a zone of comfort, 2) but they want something they don't have, 3) so they enter an unfamiliar situation, and 4) adapt to it, 5) thus getting what they wanted, but 6) pay a heavy price for it, after which they 7) return to their familiar situation, 8) having changed both themselves and the world around them.</p> <p>Though I didn't explicitly remember it, there actually are 17 phases in Campbells' monomyth!  I just picked 17 because I like prime numbers and 13 seemed too few.   </p> <p>Possibly because of that synchronicity ChatGPT initially echoed the stages of the Monomyth verbatim as the chapter titles.  I chastised it a little and asked for a redo, supplying it the story summary again.  This finally resulted in the <code>ChatGPT Chapter Title Version 2</code> titles above.</p> <p>I can get behind the thematic mapping for the first 9 or 10 chapters, but then it gets squirrelly until the last chapter or two. </p> <p>From there, I prompted chapter by chapter for the plot points, and then brainstormed the characters, using Midjourney and some creative prompting for the character sketches.  I also used Midjourney to <code>/imagine</code> what the cover of the book should look like, which I cleaned up a little to add human-readable words (most SOTA image generation at present doesn't have the ability to generate readable words quite yet).</p>"},{"location":"#read-more","title":"Read More","text":"<ul> <li>Meet the Characters - Neil, 'Rica, and the gang...</li> <li>Plot Points - Machine generated with a dash of spice</li> <li>Scene Notes - Using Kanban view to play around with the scenes (on the web it looks kinda boring, but see notes below for an idea of what it looks like in my \"IDE for thinking and writing\")</li> <li>Story Mechanics- monomythic story circles and word counts and pacing, oh my!</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#notes-on-this-site","title":"Notes on this site","text":"<p>This novel and this site are being composed in Obsidian.md, a recent 'plain text connected thinking' app I started seriously using on New Year's Eve.</p> <p>In addition to my 'private memex' of reading notes, daily logs, drafts for blog posts, to-do lists, concept maps, and project boards, I have a folder for this project which is symlinked to a stand-alone git repo which uses mkdocs to compile the website you're reading.
